Easy way to create code files with premade code snippets
#Installation
This program currently only works for linux computers (for now).
## Prerequisites
* Git
* Python 2.7 or newer

## Step-by-step
1. <code>git clone https://github.com/YRMYJASKA/EasySnippet.git</code>

   Insert this into your terminal and press enter.
2. <code>export PATH=$PATH:*Path/To/EasySnippet*</code>

   Put this into your ~/.bashrc file and replace *Path/To/EasySnippet* with the path to the directory of EasySnippet to access ezsnip from the console. Then restart your terminal or type <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> into your terminal for it to take effect.
3. Now you can use ezsnip from your terminal like in the example down below. 

# Usage
<code>ezsnip cpp class myfile</code>

This makes a C++ file with a class template named myfile
