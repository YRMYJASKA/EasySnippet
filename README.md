Easy way to create code files with premade code snippets
#Installation
This program currently only works for linux computers.

1. <code>git clone https://github.com/YRMYJASKA/EasySnippet.git</code>

   Insert this into your console and press enter
2. <code>export PATH=$PATH: *EasySnippet directory*</code>
   Put this into your ~/.bashrc file and replace  *EasySnippet directory* with the path to the directory to access ezsnip from the console
3. Now you can use ezsnip form your console like in the example down below.
